# Commons Gateway

Let's align, agree, and acellerate together!

This repository holds the front-end widgets for [Commons DAO Gateway](https://commons.build/now/). This project is configured as a [bos-workspace](https://github.com/nearbuilders/bos-workspace).

## Setup & Development

1. Initialize submodules and install packages:

```cmd
yarn run init
```

2. Start development version in mainnet:

```cmd
yarn dev
```

Or start the development version in testnet:

```cmd
yarn dev:testnet
```

This will start a gateway at http://127.0.0.1:8080 which will render your local widgets. The entry point for this app is [buildhub.near/widget/app](http://127.0.0.1:8080/buildhub.near/widget/app).
